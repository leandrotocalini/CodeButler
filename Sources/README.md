# Sources Directory

This directory contains all your code repositories that CodeButler will manage.

## How to Add a Repository

```bash
cd Sources/
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/your-repo
```

## CLAUDE.md Files

Each repository should have a `CLAUDE.md` file in its root that provides context to Claude Code about the project.

### Example CLAUDE.md

```markdown
# Project Name

## Tips

1. **Keep CLAUDE.md Updated**: When you make architectural changes, update the CLAUDE.md
2. **Be Specific**: Include information that helps Claude understand your codebase quickly
3. **Link to Docs**: Reference important documentation or wiki pages
4. **List TODOs**: Keep track of pending tasks in CLAUDE.md

## Example

See how to structure your CLAUDE.md by looking at example repositories in the wild, or use this template:

```bash
# Create CLAUDE.md template
cat > your-repo/CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# [Project Name]
