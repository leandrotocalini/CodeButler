Document recent work in JOURNEY.md. Follow these steps:

1. Read JOURNEY.md to see existing entries
2. Read recent commits with `git log --oneline -20` and diff the current branch vs main
3. Read the modified files to understand the changes in detail
4. Add a new entry at the end of JOURNEY.md in blog post format:
   - Subtitle with date (## YYYY-MM-DD — Descriptive title)
   - What was implemented (detailed, with files and functions)
   - Why it was done this way (reasoning, trade-offs, discarded alternatives)
   - How the complete flow works
5. Write in English, technical but conversational tone

Do NOT delete previous entries. Only append at the end.
