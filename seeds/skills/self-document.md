## Agent

## Prompt
Document recent work in JOURNEY.md.

1. Read the current Slack thread to understand what was accomplished
2. Read existing `JOURNEY.md` (if it exists) to follow the established format and avoid duplicating entries
3. Write a new entry with:
   - **Date** and short title
   - **What was done** — features implemented, bugs fixed, decisions made
   - **Key decisions** — why this approach was chosen over alternatives
   - **What we learned** — patterns discovered, gotchas encountered, things to remember
   - **What's next** — follow-up work, open questions, known limitations
4. Append the entry to `JOURNEY.md` (create the file if it doesn't exist)
5. Commit the change directly (no PR needed for documentation)
